# 16bit-Hello-World
A simple 16 bit hello world using BIOS interupts.

## Installation
### Linux
1. Make sure you have NASM, QEMU and QEMU extras installed. If you don't, install them.
2. Run `$ make`. This will compile and run the bootloader. If you want to look at other build options, look inside the Makefile.

### Everything else
Get Linux lol
